# RAG-Application-using-LangChain-OpenAI-and-FAISS

This repository demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using **LangChain**, **OpenAI's GPT model**, and **FAISS**. This setup combines the power of large language models with efficient retrieval systems, allowing the model to retrieve relevant information from a dataset and then generate a coherent response, enhancing its accuracy and relevance.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a powerful approach for augmenting a language model with specific domain knowledge. In this application:

- **LangChain** serves as the orchestration layer, helping to manage interactions between the language model and the retrieval system.
- **OpenAI's GPT model** is used for text generation, providing natural language responses based on the retrieved documents.
- **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an efficient library for vector similarity search, used here for retrieving relevant documents from a large dataset.

This project is contained within a Jupyter Notebook (`notebook 1`), showcasing how to set up, use, and evaluate this RAG system.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- API access to **OpenAI** (an API key is required)
- The following Python libraries:
  - `langchain`
  - `openai`
  - `faiss-cpu` (or `faiss-gpu` if using GPU for faster processing)
  - `transformers` (for additional text processing if needed)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu transformers jupyter
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

To access OpenAI’s models, you need an API key. Set up your API key in the environment or directly within the notebook:

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

### 2. Load Data and Build the FAISS Index

Load your dataset into the notebook and preprocess it. Create embeddings for each document and build a FAISS index for efficient similarity search. This process involves:

1. Loading text data.
2. Converting text into vector embeddings.
3. Storing embeddings in a FAISS index.

### 3. Define the Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipeline

Using **LangChain** as the orchestrator, set up the pipeline to retrieve relevant information from FAISS and generate responses with OpenAI’s GPT model. The pipeline should:

1. Take a user query.
2. Search the FAISS index to retrieve similar documents.
3. Use the retrieved documents as context for OpenAI's GPT model.
4. Return a generated response based on the query and retrieved context.

### 4. Running the Application

Run the notebook cells sequentially to see the pipeline in action. Enter a query to test the retrieval and generation capabilities.

## Example Usage

Once the RAG pipeline is set up, you can test it by inputting queries. For example:

```plaintext
**User Query**: "Tell me about climate change impacts on agriculture."
**RAG Output**: "Climate change affects agriculture in multiple ways, such as altering crop yields, changing water availability, and increasing the risk of extreme weather events. For instance, ... (retrieved content + GPT model response)"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **FAISS Errors**: Ensure that FAISS is installed correctly. If using a GPU, consider installing `faiss-gpu`.
- **OpenAI API Rate Limits**: If you encounter rate limits or API errors, consider adding request handling or sleep intervals between API calls.

## Future Enhancements

- **Caching Results**: Store frequently used results to speed up the process.
- **Additional Data Sources**: Incorporate more comprehensive datasets.
- **Fine-Tuning the Model**: Fine-tune the retrieval and generation steps for domain-specific responses.
